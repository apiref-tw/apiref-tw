- 👋 Hi, I’m @apiref-tw! I've been writing quality end-user and as dev-user docs, for the last 15 years. I'm a minimalistic topic-based technical writer. 
- 👀 I’m interested in writing detailed develop-facing api reference documentation that contains all the information required to work with an API, with details about the functions, classes, return types, arguments and more, supported by tutorials and examples.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the deeper nuances of authoring/rendering well-rounded API reference content.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with you as a volunteer technical writer. I'm aiming to arrive at the Right-First-Time capability with your express help.
- 📫 Please reach me at (9)(8)(9)(5)(5)(5)(6)(4)(4)(9)...We're all together in this topsy-turvy world of tech, aren’t we? So, let's do cool stuff. A quick 10-minute call? When works best for you?

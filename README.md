# Hi Github! apiref-technical writer here!

I've been writing quality end-user and dev-user docs for the last 15 years.

- 👋 Hi, I'm a minimalistic **topic-based** technical writer.
- 👀 I’m interested in writing developer-facing API reference documentation that carries all the information required to work with an API. I want tp include  details about the functions, classes, return types, arguments and more, supported by tutorials and examples.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the deeper nuances of authoring/rendering well-rounded API reference content. I want to make your life easy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with you as a volunteer technical writer. I'm aiming to reach 10/10 on *Right-First-Time* API reference docs with your express help.
- 📫 Please reach me at surajp@outlook.in...We're all together in this topsy-turvy world of tech, aren’t we? So, let's do cool stuff. A quick email? When works best for you?
